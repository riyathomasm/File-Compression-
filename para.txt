The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow across the sky as the waves gently lapped against the shore. A cool breeze carried the scent of salt and damp earth, blending with the distant laughter of children playing near the waterâ€™s edge. Seagulls soared overhead, their cries echoing through the evening air. Somewhere nearby, a fisherman reeled in his final catch of the day, his silhouette dark against the fading light. As night settled in, the stars emerged one by one, painting the sky with specks of silver, marking the beginning of yet another tranquil night by the sea.
